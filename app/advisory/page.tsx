            <strong>Yes, you can buy me. At least for a short period of time.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I am fairly respected in topics like internet in general, e-commerce, technology and entrepreneurship. I
            also know a few things on organization/culture.
          </p>
          <h2>Examples of how people use me</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Leading Advisory Boards</strong>, tackling and successfully implement the necessary changes on
              most sort of issues within the organization, from production to technology to employee to strategy
            </li>
            <li>
              Executing <strong>technical due diligences</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Helping on <strong>CTO-related tasks</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Navigating companies </strong>through important<strong> technology choices</strong>, from internal
              systems like communication/colaboration to the more complex ones like e-commerce, ERP, PIM, and similar.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pushing through critical projects.</strong> I never take on me the project manager role any
              longer. Instead I take the role to make sure the project manager and its project team implements- and
              finalizes the project
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Specifications</strong> on new services and features, both <strong>written docs</strong> and{" "}
              <strong>UX sketches</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Building up tech/dev teams</strong>, assisting on job interviews, setting up teams etc
            </li>
            <li>
              General <strong>business advisory</strong> (e.g "How can we do this?" or "Should we proceed with this?")
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>My rates</h2>
          <p>
            I charge differently depending on the size of the companies I assist, based upon either the number of
            employees or the annual revenue, whichever comes first.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for the differentiated rate is simply because it gives different value to a small company
            compared to a larger enterprise, and also that the risk involved is much higher with the larger ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, these are my <strong>hourly rates</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1-9 employees or &lt; 1MNOK in annual revenue: NOK 1337,-</li>
            <li>10+ employees or 1-100MNOK in annual revenue: NOK 1600,-</li>
            <li>
              100+ employees or &gt;100MNOK in annual revenue: <strong>NOK 2200,-</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Minimum charge is <strong>10 hours</strong>. No refund or anything.{" "}

              Just plain simple trust

            .
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I also have a "one-day-all-you-can-eat-Roy" full-day price:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>For all types of companies: NOK 12.500.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Travel costs, VAT and other relevant expenses are added to the tap according to official standard rates.

            My <strong>25+ years of experience</strong> and <strong>extensive network</strong> is always{" "}

          <h2>Can we employ you?</h2>
          <p>Neh.</p>
          <h2>I need to enjoy working with your company</h2>
          <p>
            To be able to be truly useful and super-efficient in the work I do,{" "}
            <strong>I really have to enjoy the work I do</strong>. This means I only take assignments for clients I
            truly belive in and <em>which am confident I can have a positive impact for</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, if you are selling sand in Sahara or you are selling listing classified ads on
            phone-number-lookup-portals, I will most likely turn the request gracefully down.

          <h2>Disclaimer / EULA</h2>
          <p>
            In no way what-so-ever I will guarantee that my assistance will help you or your company succeed. In order
            for a good relationship there needs to be a perfect balance of trust between the client and the supplier.
            So, my disclaimer is simply the need for trust. Check out the below video to learn what I mean.

            some tasks, I'll consider it. Everything is for sale, I guess.
